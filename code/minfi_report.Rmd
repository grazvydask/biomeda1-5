# DNA methylation signature of human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder

- GEO ID: GSE80261

The data describes genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of
buccal epithelial cells taken from 206 children, 96 of which are controls
and 110 are cases. DNA was analysed using the IlluminaHumanMethylation450 array.

## The data

Dimensions of the data:

```{r dims, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
print(minfi_outs$dims)
```

That is, there are `r minfi_outs$dims[2]` samples and 
`r minfi_outs$dims[1]` probes.


## Info on some samples

```{r sample summary, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(print(minfi_outs$samp_info)))
```

## Info on some probes

```{r probe summary, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(print(minfi_outs$probe_info)))
#print(minfi_outs$probe_info)
```
